				<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

			<td><p>When graphic designers need to show how text will look in a layout, but don’t have the real copy yet, they may use a series of nonsensical words called “greeking”. While “hipster greeking” may sound like a guy with thick-rimmed glasses sipping ouzo, it’s actually the product of a clever site that generates Lorem Ipsum text punctuated with hipster lingo. For those looking to pepper their greeked text with a fixie, a ‘stache, or a particular penchant for glasses, hipsteripsum.me is worth checking out. Here’s a sample in Hipster with a splash of Latin.</p></td>
